# PolyTasks
This is a mini project I made which consists in a platform that lets users create tasks and hire someone to complete that task.

## Frameworks and dependecies

* React (TypeScript)
  * @types/react
* Next.js
  * next-images
* React Bootstrap
* auth0 for Next.js
* Mongoose

## Database and Hosting
For this project I decided to use **MongoDB Atlas** to host my mongodb

This project is hosted on **Verel** which is optimzed to host Next.js projects
Take a look at the project [here](https://acklen-avenue-challenge.vercel.app/)
